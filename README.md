## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the **source code**, **hardware schematics**, and **documentation** for a telemetry system designed to monitor vehicle parameters such as **speed** and **acceleration/braking**.  
The system was developed as part of an **engineering thesis** and is based on **LoRa**, **GPS**, and **accelerometer** technologies.

The goal of the project was to create a **low-cost, wireless telemetry system** that enables **free long-range data transmission** without dependence on GSM networks or external infrastructure.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The telemetry system consists of the following main components:

- 🧠 **Raspberry Pi 4B** – central unit for data collection and processing  
- 🛰️ **Multi-GNSS L76K** – GPS module for vehicle speed and position measurement  
- 📈 **ADXL345** – 3-axis accelerometer for acceleration and braking analysis  
- 📡 **LoRa Wio-E5 (STM32WLE5JC)** – wireless data transmission module operating at 868 MHz  
- 💻 **PC Station (Receiver)** – receives, processes, and visualizes data using a custom MATLAB app  
- 🔋 **Li-Pol Battery (4000 mAh)** – provides portable power  
- ⚡ **TP4056 Charger & S13V30F5 Converter** – charging and power stabilization

## 💻 Software

### 🐍 Raspberry Pi (Python)
The main script (`kod_wszystko.py`) performs:
- Initialization of sensors (GPS, accelerometer)  
- Data acquisition and conversion to hexadecimal  
- LoRa transmission using AT commands  
- Error handling and connection monitoring  

### 🧮 Receiver Application (MATLAB)
The MATLAB application includes:
- Serial communication setup with LoRa receiver  
- Data conversion from HEX to physical values (speed, acceleration, coordinates)  
- Real-time visualization (speed, acceleration, GPS path)  
- Data saving to `.csv` files and plot export

## 🛰️ LoRa Configuration

Both LoRa modules are configured in **P2P mode** with the following parameters:

```bash
AT+MODE=TEST
AT+TEST=RFCFG,F:868300000,SF7,BW125K,TXPR:8,RXPR:8,POW:14,CRC:ON,IQ:OFF,NET:OFF
```

### Key Settings:
| Parameter | Value | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Frequency | 868.3 MHz | EU868 band |
| Spreading Factor | SF7 | Fast transmission, low sensitivity |
| Bandwidth | 125 kHz | Standard LoRa bandwidth |
| Power | 14 dBm | Max legal EU868 power |
| CRC | ON | Error control enabled |

## 🧰 MATLAB App Features

The graphical interface includes:

- **Dropdowns** for COM port and baud rate selection  
- **Buttons** for system control:
  - ▶️ **START** – begins data acquisition  
  - ⏹️ **STOP** – stops transmission  
  - 📊 **DRAW** – plots acceleration and speed  
  - 💾 **SAVE** – saves data to timestamped folders  
- **Text area** displaying system messages:
  - “Udane połączenie szeregowe” – Successful serial connection  
  - “Rysowanie wykresów” – Drawing plots  
  - “Zapis danych do folderu” – Saving data to folder

## 🧪 System Testing

Tests were conducted in two environments:

| Environment | Max Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Urban area | ~550 m | Occasional GPS signal loss due to obstacles |
| Open field | ~1.3 km | Stable and reliable communication |

Additional test results:
- ⏱️ Operating time: ~1h 45min on a 4000 mAh battery  
- ⚡ Average current draw: ~2.28 A  
- 🔌 Charging time: ~4h 40min (5 V / 1 A)

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Real-time wireless telemetry  
- Data visualization and export  
- Long-range LoRa communication (up to 1.3 km)  
- Modular and scalable architecture  
- Low power consumption and compact design
